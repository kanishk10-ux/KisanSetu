KisanSetu: Smart Farming Advisor
Empowering farmers with data-driven insights, localized schemes, and land-specific guidance.

Project Overview
KisanSetu is a lightweight, web platform designed to bridge the information gap for rural farmers. By entering their Region, Land Size, and Soil Type, farmers receive personalized recommendations on:


Government Schemes: Direct links to subsidies and financial aid they are eligible for.

Crop Optimization: What to plant based on their specific land acreage.

Actionable Advice: Localized agricultural practices based on regional climate and soil data.

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <https://github.com/Hardik12244/KisanSetu>

2. Install Dependencies

Run: npm install

4. Start Backend Server

Run: node index.js

Server will start at:

http://localhost:3000

4. Run Frontend

Open: index.html

in your browser.

Key Features
 Regional Localization: Tailored content for specific States and Districts.

 Scalable Advice: Different logic for Marginal, Small, and Large-scale land holdings.

 Live Weather Integration: Real-time updates to help with daily farming decisions.

Tech Stack

This project is built using a "Clean Web" approach to ensure maximum speed and compatibility:

HTML5: Semantic structure for accessibility

CSS3: Custom Flexbox/Grid layouts 

JavaScript (Vanilla): Dynamic filtering logic and API handling

JSON: Localized database for schemes and crop data

How It Works (The Logic)
The application follows a simple three-step logic flow:

Input: User selects District (e.g., Nashik) and Land Size (e.g., 1.5 Hectares).

Process: JavaScript parses schemes.json to find matches for the region and size category.

Output: The DOM updates dynamically to show "Your Recommended Schemes" and "Best Crops for Your Land."

Roadmap
[ ] Phase 1: Data collection for initial 5 states.

[ ] Phase 2: Build responsive UI components.

[ ] Phase 3: Implement JavaScript filtering engine.

[ ] Phase 4: Integrate Weather API.

[ ] Phase 5: Add PWA (Progressive Web App) support for offline use.
